# Magic-Eye-Solver
This simple HTML page makes it possible to view a Magic Eye image.
The image can be uploaded via an upload button, by dragging and dropping it, or by using a URL.
The image can be moved to the right or left with a slider, all with the mouse or cursor keys.
Unfortunately, the cursor key function does not work in the Safari browser.
After uploading the image, you can switch to full screen mode and also load a new image,
but you should first click the Reset button so that the proportions are correct.
The Info button provides information about how the whole thing works.
