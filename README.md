# Magic-Eye-Solver
This simple HTML page makes it possible to resolve a Magic Eye image.
The image can be uploaded via upload button, drag and drop or via URL.
The image can be moved to the right or left with the slider.
All with the mouse or the cursor keys.
Unfortunately, the cursor key function does not work in the Safari browser.
After uploading the image, you can switch to full screen mode and also load a new image,
but you should first click the Reset Burron so that the proportions are correct.
The info button provides information about how the whole thing works.
